Application Organize.me for planning your day. I created this app from the Udemy course of Juriy Bura, React + Redux - Professional Development. To try this app, go to related website in ABOUT tab in the right side. 
If you cloned the repository on your own PC and want to try application, use this commands:
1. npm install (create node_modules folder)
2. npm start (open your browser and start a project)

The branch gh-pages have a production code of the project
